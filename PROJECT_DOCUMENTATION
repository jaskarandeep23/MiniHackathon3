## Project Overview

This project is an interactive JavaScript webpage created for the Module 03 Mini Hackathon. The theme focuses on building a webpage that uses JavaScript to make the user experience dynamic and engaging. Our main objective was to apply concepts such as variables, functions, loops, event listeners, and DOM manipulation. The final webpage includes two interactive features: a Number Guessing Game and a Simple Quiz. These activities demonstrate our understanding of JavaScript logic and how to update webpage content based on user actions.
